# Tweaks for Linux Desktop
## ubuntu-mc-desktop-fix.sh
Script that creates a proper GNOME desktop launcher for Midnight Commander (mc):
- mc has its own icon in the Ubuntu dock (not grouped under the terminal).
- You can open new windows via right-click → New Window.
- Each window starts with a 170×44 terminal size by default.
- Works for current user only
